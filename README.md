# MED-Algorithm-NLP

 Implement a MED algorithm with a user interface, which takes input as a ‘word’ and lists its first 5 alternative correct words (list nearest 5 words) by using the dictionary given (vocabulary_tr.txt).

Part 2 (60 p): For given two words, find the MED value of transforming from first word to second, show the steps in a table and write the operations’ names needed to transform.

* The algorithm should be implemented either in C# or Java.
* Write a report including;
           - Your number and name,
           - Definition of your algorithm (functions, procedures, inputs and outputs),
           - Screenshots of your program,
           - Test results:

total running time for Part 1 and Part 2 (for one run),
for Part 1: words - alternative correct words list for at least 5 different words with 5 nearest words,
for Part 2: run the algorithm 2 times and write the results for any words you choose (screen shots of the solution for each run).

Upload your project, report and runnable file of the project (.exe file by changing the extension with .ex) until due date in a zip file called as your student number.

Notes:

- User interface will be evaluated as 5 points in each part.

- You do not have to write a cover page on the report; you can just write your name and number on the first page.
